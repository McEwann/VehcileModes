# VehicleModes

A very simple script that allows a toggle mode between "Patrol" and "pursuit" when in a car defined in client/main.lua

0.01 msec idle
0.03 msec active

Vehicle boost is being handled by SetVehicleEnginepowermult & SetVehicleTorqueMult which both require looping every tick


This is a very simple script just done as a test, I have plans to make an actual resource out of this with different modes that are more customisable and possibly using 
vehicle meta handling updates.
